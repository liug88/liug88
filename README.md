### What I've been up to

At **askROI**, I built an AI routing system that picks the right model based on query complexity—cut costs by **73%** while keeping response times under a second. Also shipped HuggingFace MCP OAuth integration that now powers 15+ services for our voice agent platform.

Before that, I redesigned a healthcare scheduling platform that bumped user engagement by 15%, and built a campaign management backend handling 10k+ concurrent campaigns.

I like solving problems where the architecture actually matters.

### Projects

**[CascadeLearn](https://github.com/liug88/cascadelearn)** — The AI routing system I mentioned. Routes queries to GPT-4, Claude, or smaller models based on complexity scoring. Python, FastAPI, React.

**[Plancake](https://github.com/liug88/plancake)** — Scheduling platform for RPI clubs. Ended up being used by a few orgs on campus. React, Node, PostgreSQL.

**[CARPI](https://github.com/liug88/carpi)** — 4-year course planner for RPI students with Discord bot integration. Helped solve the "what do I take next semester" problem.
